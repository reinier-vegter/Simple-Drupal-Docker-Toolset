## Drupal development toolkit based on Docker

Visit at Github Pages: http://reinier-vegter.github.io/Simple-Drupal-Docker-Toolset/

With this toolset, you can install docker and easily fire up any existing Drupal (or php) webroot in 2 seconds.
 - drupal 6,7,8 (or basically any PHP app by disabling the drupal check, NO_DRUPAL_CHECK=1)
 - SSL support
 - PHP 5.4, 5.6 (default), 7.0
 - Apache 2.2
 - one MySQL container for all projects (data saved in your local home-folder).
 - one Drupal container + hostname per project
 - Solr 4 container for each project, data storage in project folder, and auto-using of search_api_solr config files.
 - mailsink that collects al emails sent through sendmail (/tmp/d7-docker-mailsink on host)
 - varnish out-of-the-box (See 'CUSTOM PROJECT CONFIGURATION')
 - memcache
 - custom mounts, dns entries, solr-config, local hostnames
 - XHProf / XHGui

### INSTALLATION

#### Get this toolset first
Clone git repository somewehere in local folder, or download archive package, and unpack.

    git clone https://github.com/reinier-vegter/Simple-Drupal-Docker-Toolset.git ~/docker-drupal



#### GNU/Linux distro:
 - Install docker:
   - `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`
 - Add yourself to docker group:
   - `sudo usermod -aG docker [YOUR USER]`
 - Then, logout your system and login again
 - Run `bin/install.sh` to symlink all needed scripts to your bin folder.
 - Give write access to yourself on hosts file:
   - `sudo chown root:$(whoami) /etc/hosts`
   - `sudo chmod 664 /etc/hosts`


#### OSX
From: https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/
- Install toolbox from https://www.docker.com/toolbox
- Open Docker Quickstart Terminal and close when finished
- Open VirtualBox and assign more CPU's to the 'default' VM, as it will be quite slow by default (only 1 CPU)
- Add your user to 'wheel' group, in terminal (so the toolset can add hostname-entries to your hosts file):
  - `sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $(whoami) -t user wheel`
- Give wheel-group write access to hosts file, in terminal:
  - `sudo chmod 664 /etc/hosts`
- Run the following command to symlink all needed scripts to your bin folder.
  - `sudo bin/install.sh`


### UPDATE TOOLSET
  Do a git pull to fetch the latest master-branch for this toolset.
  Then, run `bin/install.sh` again.

                                            when you stop a d7 container.
        - d7-logs [num|all]               : Tail all apache logs.

                                            alias drush="d7-drush"   to your .bashrc file (~/.bashrc).
        - d7-help                         : Show README


### Commands for toolset development

        - d7-build-docker-image           : Build / rebuild docker images. This replaces images that are downloaded from dockerhub.


***

### QUICK START

To start your project, go to the project folder, and run 'd7-start'
Note that settings.php must contain the mysql-host 'mysql-docker.dev',
and that solr is reachable at localhost:8983 from each drupal container.

Building docker images is done the first time you use them ("d7-start"), and can take a while.


### Common hostnames
 - mysql-docker.dev                :  Location of mysql server, reachable from host and container
 - dockerhost                      :  Location of your laptop / server. Reachable from container.
                                      To make it reachable from your laptop/server,
                                      just add '127.0.0.1 dockerhost' to /etc/hosts .


***

### CUSTOM PROJECT CONFIGURATION
Custom docker stuff per project:
Add file .d7-docker.conf to your project folder.

**Be aware that any bash code in this file is actually executed**

Example content of file:

        # Add dependency container.
        # Format: [container name]:[start-script/command]
        # CUST_DEPENDENCIES=(
        #   "docker.mysql:${mydir}/d7-mysql-start.sh"
        #   "docker.solr4:${mydir}/d7-solr4-start.sh"
        # )
        #
        # Add custom link between containers.
        # Format: [dependency container name]:[hostname in 'this' container, mapped to dependency]
        # CUST_LINK=(
        #   "docker.mysql:mysql-docker.dev"
        #   "docker.solr4:solr4-docker.dev"
        # )
        #
        # Mount extra volumes in container.
        # Format: [local folder]:[folder in container]
        # CUST_VOL="/opt/simplesamlphp:/opt/simplesamlphp1"
        #
        # Give container extra hostnames.
        # CUST_HOSTNAMES=(
        #   "dev.my-favorite-hostname.com"
        # )
        #
        # Provide DNS (hosts-file) entries to container, so container can resolve it.
        # For example usefull if you're having trouble to get docker to communicate through host-system VPN.
        # CUST_DNS=(
        #    www.google-dns.com:8.8.4.4
        # )
        #
        # Do not check if this is actually Drupal. Usable for 'other' php apps to be ran in
        # a D7 container.
        # NO_DRUPAL_CHECK=1
        #
        # Enable Varnish cache engine
        # VARNISH_ENABLE=1
        # Note: This will run Varnish on port 80 (so Drupal can talk to varnish on 127.0.0.1:80)
        # and Apache on port 90.
        # Note: To purge a page, let Drupal call URL's on varnish with the PURGE-method (like GET, but
        # make it PURGE...). The purge and expire modules are a very useful combination to do this.
        #
        # Enable memcache daemon
        # MEMCACHED_ENABLE=1
        #
        # Enable XHGui
        # XHGUI_ENABLE=1
        #
        # Set PHP version to use
        # PHP_VERSION=5.4
        # Supported versions: 5.4, 5.6, 7.0.
        # Defaults to 5.6
        #
        # Custom per-project php.ini
        # CUST_PHP_INI="/opt/web/flightcontrol/php.ini"
        # Make sure to use an absolute path here!
        #
        # Custom location for Solr config files.
        # Note that the toolset finds 'search_api_solr/solr-conf/4.x' automatically.
        # Only use this if you use some other module, or schema files of your own.
        # SOLR_CONF_OVERRIDES='sites/all/modules/contrib/search_api_solr/solr-conf/4.x'
        #

### Use of XDebug

XDebug is installed in the container.
To use it with php-storm
 - make sure to just enable the listener (no server config needed, defaults work fine) in order to start debugging.
   ![PHPStorm XDebug listener](images/listener.png)
 - Generate the bookmarklets at https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/ , to start/stop the debugger.

That's all...


To use XDebug profiler, just add a 'profiler' folder in your project.
It will generate cachegrind files that you can open with KCacheGrind or any other tool.
See http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler
